### IN CLASS: ILLUSTRATOR/VINYL CUTTER PRACTICE

To get some practice using Illustrator and the vinyl cutter, we'll make some small stickers.

1. Create an artboard that is `6x6 inches`  
2. Using the type tool, write out a really short text: your first name, initials, or a word  
3. Adjust the font, size, etc to make an interesting composition (consider splitting the letters into individual objects for more control)  

When you're ready, grab me and we'll cut it out! You can then weed your vinyl and apply the transfer tape. If you've finished, you can go ahead and start sketching out ideas for your homework in Illustrator.

### CREATE A FIGURE WITH LETTERS  

Your assignment this week is to create a figure using only letters, numbers, and other typographical symbols. If you've used Illustrator before, please avoid shapes, the pen tool, etc. The figure can be a person, robot, animal... whatever you want!

A few guidelines:

* Create an artboard that is `12 inches` wide and `24 inches` high  
* Your figure should fill most of the artboard with approx `1 inch` border all around  
* Use different fonts along with scale and rotation to create your figure  
* Avoid really tiny letters and fonts with super fine lines  
* Download additional fonts in the Creative Cloud app!  

When done, upload your Illustrator file to Canvas.

Next week in class, we'll do the final prep for your file and cut everything. We'll also install your vinyl in the hall! **If you want to use your own vinyl, please be sure it's Oracal 631 or a similar removeable type!** If you're not sure the vinyl you found will be ok, send me an email to double-check.
