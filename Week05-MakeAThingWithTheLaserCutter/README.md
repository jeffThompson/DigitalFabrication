### OVERVIEW  
As our last project on the laser cutter (aside from possibly using it for your final project), your assignment is to make something awesome! Aside from using the laser cutter as the main tool, the other details are all wide open: what you make, the materials you use, etc. Your project can be functional, decorative, or an artwork... the goal should be to make an ambitious, fanastic laser-cut thing!

Open-ended projects can be tricky, so I'd suggest thinking about what materials your drawn to and/or what they can do well. For example, acrylic engraves really nicely and comes in tons of colors; plywood can be painted and is eco-friendly. See the [materials database](http://jeffreythompson.org/lasercutter/) for other material options. You might also consider the challenge of desigining in 2D but creating something that is assembled into 3D!

Because everyone will be working on different things, we'll have fewer demos and more open studio time for you to work, get help, and use the laser cutter.

### FOR FEBRUARY 27  
For next week, please continue working on your project. You may want to do some test cuts in the Fab Lab (on your main material or chipboard, cardboard, or paper).

Be sure to order materials and supplies you might need as well! New materials can require some testing, so be sure to give yourself enough time. You'll want to make sure you have any consumables you need too: glue, sandpaper, paint, etc.

> Please think of at least one thing you have a question about or need help with! Post your question/thing you need help with to Canvas.

Come with work in progress you can get feedback on and your materials, ready for a studio day next week.

### FOR MARCH 6  
For next week, please finish your lasercut project. The goal should be a refined version of your idea: think about how all the parts work together visually (and functionally, if that's important), how you finish the materials, etc. No need to turn in anything on Canvas, just bring your project ready to show everyone. (Be sure to check the Fab Lab hours this week!)

Additionally, please be sure to [install and open Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/education). We'll dive right in next week, so if you have any issues be sure to email me asap. Please also bring your mouse and any USB adapter you need to every class, starting next week.
