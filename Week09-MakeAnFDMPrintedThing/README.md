# MAKE AN FDM-PRINTED THING

### TLDR

* Due April 3  
  * March 27: ideation  
    * 20 sketches  
    * Detailed drawing that fills an `8.5x11"` sheet    
    * Bonus: start your 3D model  
    * Upload a photo of your large drawing to Canvas and bring to class  
  * April 3: model your project  
    * Export STL from Fusion  
    * We'll slice them together in class next week
* Make something in Fusion 360  
  * And print it in the Fab Lab!

### OVERVIEW  

Having learned the basics of Fusion 360 and the FDM printer, your assignment over the next two weeks is to make a 3D-printed thing! You should design your project from scratch using Fusion and print it in the Fab Lab using the FDM printers.

What you make is completely up to you: it could be a sculpture, a functional object, something decorative, a tool. Your design can use non-printed parts/materials, but the main focus should be on what you design and print.

A few limitations to consider:  
* The FDM printer can't do super-fine details  
* Overhanging parts will need supports  
* Large objects can take 12â€“24+ hours to print  

And a few things FDM *can* do!  
* Join multiple prints with glue  
  * Or bolts, etc  
* Sand, fill, and paint (though a smooth surface takes a lot of work)

### FOR MONDAY, MARCH 27  

Starting in class (and to be finished as your homework), you should begin planning your project. The goal here is not just to figure out *what* to make but also to quickly explore possibilities and refine details. We'll do this by drawing by hand before going into the computer. This process, called [*paper prototyping*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping), helps keep you from getting bogged down in Fusion commands and instead lets you ideate quickly using a medium that allows for easy changes. This week, you should do two things...

First, draw at least 20 different possibilities for your project. This might be 20 totally distinct ideas, 20 variations on one idea, or more likely a combination of both. These drawings should be rough but clear: they're a way to quickly work through possibilities. Getting stuck at this stage is a good thing! Passing the hump of no more ideas helps get you past the obvious ones and into new territory.

Once you have an idea of what you'd like to do, start a new drawing that refines your idea. This should fill at least an `8.5x11 inch` sheet of paper and be as detailed as possible! Feel free to use annotations and notes to describe details that might not be obvious in the drawing.

> It's totally ok if you don't feel like you're great at drawing by hand! This process is less about making beautiful drawings as it is about thinking *through* drawing, figuring things out, and explaining your ideas to us.

When you're done, please upload a photo of your large drawing to Canvas and bring it to class next week. If you have time, you can start modeling in Fusion too.

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 3  
This week, you should finish modeling your project in Fusion and export it to an STL file. We'll slice them together in class next week (and cover some extra Cura stuff) to make sure they're ready to print.

When sliced, please submit your file to the Fab Lab for printing. We'll give everyone two weeks to have your files printed and for you to clean up and do any finishing required.

We'll also be starting a new project next week using the resin printer! It's capable of incredibly fine detail and delicate parts. If you have time, it would be good to start thinking about what you might want to make for this project too.
