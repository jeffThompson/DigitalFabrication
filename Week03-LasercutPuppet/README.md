### OVERVIEW  
The vinyl cutter is a great introduction to Illustrator and 2D digital fabrication, but its big limitation is it can only work with one material! The lasercutter is a much more versatile and powerful machine, capable of cutting paper, cardboard, wood, plastic, and lots of other materials.

For our first lasercutter project, you'll design and assemble a puppet with at least three parts, joined with metal fasteners. We'll use chipboard, a kind of pressed paper: it's cheap, cuts and engraves easily, and is recycleable. You'll start the project desigining the head of your puppet, then we'll prototype additional elements before cutting a final version.

You're also welcome to add additional materials to create hair, jewelry, clothing, whatever! The chipboard will warp if you paint it, but we can add lots of laser-engraved details.

For these multi-week assignments, you can find the basic info here. The details of what's due each week can be found in the weekly parts, found in this folder.
