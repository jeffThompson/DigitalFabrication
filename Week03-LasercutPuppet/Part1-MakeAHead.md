### CREATE AN ILLUSTRATOR FILE  
To get started, create a new Illustrator project:

* Set the artboard to `6 x 6 inches`  
* And the color mode to `RGB`  

The color mode is extra important here, as you'll see next week! If you forget, you can change it later under `File > Document color mode...`

### MAKE A HEAD  
Your puppet can be a person, animal, robot, monster, whatever! To get started with your puppet, this week you'll design the head. This is a really expressive part of the character, so this is a good place to put as much detail as possible.

Think about what will be cut out and what will be engraved, keeping in mind how vector and raster engraving will look:

You'll also need to think about where the head will connect to the body (or whatever it connects to!). Add a circle to be cut out that is `0.25 inches` in diameter. We'll use metal fasteners to make this a moveable joint.

When you have a design you like, adjust the color of the stroke (lines) to note what will be cut and what will be engraved:

* Cut: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`  
* Vector engrave: `rgb(0, 0, 255)`  
* Raster engrave: `rgb(0, 0, 0)` &larr; note this is fill color, not outline!  

We'll do a few additional things to prep your file for cutting next week in class, then cut out your puppet's head and start working on the body.
