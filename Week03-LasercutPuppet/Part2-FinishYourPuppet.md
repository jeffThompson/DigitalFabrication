* Create a torso and two limbs for your puppet  
  * Chipboard sheets are `22 x 30 inches` and cost `$2` each  
  * Feel free to revise your head design  
  * More parts ok too!  
* Have your file ready for cutting in class next week

### CREATE A TORSO AND TWO (OR MORE) LIMBS  
This week, your assignment is to create the rest of your puppet's body! What this looks like will depend a lot of what kind of creature you're designing, but your puppet should include:

* Head from this week (feel free to revise if you want!)  
* Torso or other main body section  
* At least two limbs (tentacles, etc)  

Like with the head, try to include as many cool details as you can! Think about using engraving to add decoration, clothes, and other details that will give more interest to your puppet and help tell its story.

You'll also need to consider the joints of your puppet. We'll connect them with metal fasteners that require `0.15 inch` diameter holes. Lastly, we'll use bamboo skewers as the sticks to control our puppets. We'll spend some time experimenting in class with their placement, but you might want to think about that now as well, especially ways you can create secondary movement.

### PREP YOUR FILE  
When finished, be sure your file is ready for the lasercutter! Save a copy as a `PDF` so you can still edit the original. I like to call mine `WhateverFilename-CUT.pdf` so I can quickly tell which is which.

Additionally, check these settings:  
* Check that `File > Document color mode...` is set to `RGB`
* Cut lines: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`  
* Vector engrave: `rgb(0, 0, 255)`  
* Raster engrave: grayscale fill  
* Stroke width: `0.001 inches`  
* Joint-hole diameter: `0.15 inches`  
* Be sure to check for overlapping lines!

### START THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT PROJECT  
Next week, we'll start our second laser cutter project. The approach and materials are wide open: you just need to make something awesome using the laser cutter! You might want to start thinking about ideas this week so you can get right to work on it.
