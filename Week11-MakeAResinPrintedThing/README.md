### OVERVIEW  
As our last project before the final, your assignment is to make something using Fusion 360 and the resin printer. Like our last project, what you make is totally up to you! 

Like the FDM printer, there are some things the resin printer does really well and some it doesn't. The resin printer is great for super fine details, accurate parts, and smooth surfaces. It's not so good at larger parts, especially broad flat surfaces, and all parts require some cleanup with sandpaper or needle files to remove marks from the supports.

We'll cover all the steps for using the resin printer, from slicing to cleanup. But, because we'll have so many prints to run, the Fab Lab will handle washing and curing your prints for you.

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 10  
For next week, please decide what you'd like to make and start modeling in Fusion. Get as much modeling done as you can and keep a list of stuff you need help with.

In class next week, we'll go over slicing your model for resin printing in detail – there are quite a few things to consider. **Be sure to download and install [Chitubox Basic](https://www.chitubox.com/en/download/chitubox-free)!**

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 17  
**NOTE! We'll be visiting Leeform in Brooklyn this week. Updates will be posted here and on Canvas.**

Since we'll be at Leerform this week, your assignment will be to finish your model, slice it for the resin printer, and submit it to the Fab Lab for printing.

You should also write up a proposal for your final project – details can be found in the assignment for the final.
