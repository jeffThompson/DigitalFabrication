# MAKE A RESIN-PRINTED THING

### TLDR

* Due April 24  
  * April 10...  
    * Start modeling your project in Fusion  
    * Install [Chitubox Basic](https://www.chitubox.com/en/download/chitubox-free)  
    * Nothing to turn in on Canvas  
  * April 17...  
    * Visit Leeform in Brooklyn  
    * Finish your model for the resin printer
    * Add supports etc in Chitubox
    * Save the `.chitubox` file and upload to Canvas (not the `STL` or sliced `.ctb` file!)
    * I'll double-check everything and submit to the Fab Lab for you
* Make something in Fusion 360  
  * And print it in the Fab Lab!

### OVERVIEW  
As our last project before the final, your assignment is to make something using Fusion 360 and the resin printer. Like our last project, what you make is totally up to you! 

SLA, or stereolithography, is another common type of 3D printing. Unlike the FDM printer, which goops out plastic, the SLA printer uses a UV-sensitive liquid resin, which is cured layer-by-layer using a special video screen. This means super fine details, accurate parts, and smooth surfaces, especially on really small pieces. SLA printing isn't so good at larger parts, especially broad flat surfaces, and all parts require some cleanup with sandpaper or needle files to remove marks from the supports.

We'll cover all the steps for using the resin printer, from slicing to cleanup. But, because we'll have so many prints to run, the Fab Lab will handle washing and curing your prints for you.

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 10  
For next week, please decide what you'd like to make and start modeling in Fusion. Get as much modeling done as you can and keep a list of stuff you need help with.

In class next week, we'll go over slicing your model for resin printing in detail – there are quite a few things to consider. **Be sure to download and install [Chitubox Basic](https://www.chitubox.com/en/download/chitubox-free)!**

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 17  
**NOTE! We'll be visiting Leeform in Brooklyn this week. Updates will be posted here and on Canvas.**

Since we'll be at Leerform this week, your assignment will be to finish your model and slice it for the resin printer. Submit the file on Canvas – I'll take a look and make sure everything looks ok, then I'll send it to the Fab Lab for you.

You should also write up a proposal for your final project – [details can be found in the assignment for the final](https://github.com/jeffThompson/DigitalFabrication/tree/main/Week13-FinalProject).
