### ORDER SUPPLIES  

You'll need a couple of things right away, so please order or buy them in person ASAP! You can find the list of required supplies here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16T6cnRTnbwq0T4E4lAPJm2qeyNSY0rwVBPpoPIhX0ZA/edit#gid=0

(You won't need the mouse quite yet, so no sweat if you want to shop around.)

The Fab Lab stocks black and white vinyl, but if you want to try other colors you can order some! We'll be using [Oracal 631](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=oracal+631&i=arts-crafts&crid=1WIG85IZBDBMP&sprefix=oracal+631%2Carts-crafts%2C79&ref=nb_sb_noss_1), which is removable – **make sure you don't buy any other kind or you'll have to learn drywall repair!** You can buy it from Amazon or get Cricut-brand removable vinyl from Michaels.

> **Please also be sure you have money on your DuckBills!** You'll use this to pay for things in the Fab Lab, including the vinyl for our first assignment. The Fab Lab can't take cash or any other form of payment.

### DOWNLOAD/TEST ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR  

For the next month, Adobe Illustrator will be our CAD program of choice. This week, please make sure it's installed and working!

**VA&T majors:** you probably already have Adobe installed, but if not you should talk with Prof. Chris Manzione to get sorted. Either way, please actually open Illustrator and make sure everything is good to go!

**Non-majors:** you should have received an email from IT regarding access. Please install Creative Cloud, then you can install Illustrator from the app. If you need help, the [IT TRAC Office](https://www.stevens.edu/it-support) can help! Please be sure you open Illustrator and confirm everything is working.

### PICK A POEM  

Your first project will be to lay out a poem in Illustrator and cut it on the vinyl cutter. To get a head start, spend some time this week picking 2–3 poems you might like to work with. These can be poems you already like but is also a great chance to find something new!

If you want some starting points, I suggest:

* [Poetry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems) has a wonderful site with tons of poems, which you can even filter by subject!  
* [Ubuweb](https://www.ubu.com/ethno/poems.html) has a nice "sampler" of [ethnopoetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnopoetics) pieces, mostly translated from other languages  
* [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/poems) has a great online collection of contemporary poetry  

Avoid super short (less than four lines) or long poems (unless you want to excerpt).
