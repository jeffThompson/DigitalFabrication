### OVERVIEW  
As our last project of the semester, you should make something (anything!) using one or more of the processes we've covered. Like some of our previous assignments, this can be an artwork, something functional, a tool, etc. Whatever you make, it should be an ambitious project that pushes the skills you've learned and is polished and fully complete.

You're welcome to include other media in your project, and I encourage you to think about creative ways of combining processes! For example, you might use the laser cutter to create an object, then the vinyl cutter to apply decoration.

You can also use any software you'd like for this project! (Though I don't suggest learning anything new at this point.)

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 17  
As you wrap up your resin printer project, you should also write up a short proposal for your final project. The goal here is to articulate what you want to do and to think about the resources needed and steps you'll take to complete it.

Your proposal should include:  
* 1–2 paragraphs explaining what you'll make: paint a word-picture for us and be as detailed as possible!  
* List of tools and supplies you'll need, including tools for assembly/finishing  
* Timeline for the project, with weekly deliverables up to the critique  
  * What will you have done each week?  
* 2 (or more) challenges you anticipate with this project – can be technical, creative, etc  
* 1 (or more) things we haven't learned yet but you'd be excited to hear more about  

When done, please submit your proposal on Canvas, either as a PDF or in the text entry box.

### FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS  
Over the last two weeks of the semester, you should continue making progress on your project, identifying the things you need help with, and thinking about supplies you may need and the timeline for your project. This will vary depending on what you're working on, so please come to class ready to show work in progress (whatever that might look like for you!) and to have studio time.

**Please note the last day to submit files for printing in the Fab Lab is Monday, May 1!** You can laser cut yourself any time up until our final critique, but it will be best to do any Fab Lab related tasks as early as you can. This will give you time to make changes to your files and avoid the crowd.

### FOR MONDAY, MAY 8 AT 9AM  
Our final critique is scheduled for Monday, May 8 from 9–11am (actually, it's supposed to start at 8am but that's waaaay too early). Your project should be finished and ready to present by the start of class. Depending on what you're working on, this might include sanding, painting, assembly, etc.

No need to turn in anything on Canvas – I'll take some pictures during our critique.
