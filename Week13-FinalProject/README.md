### OVERVIEW  
As our last project of the semester, you should make something (anything!) using one or more of the processes we've covered. Like some of our previous assignments, this can be an artwork, something functional, a tool, etc. Whatever you make, it should be an ambitious project that pushes the skills you've learned and is polished and fully complete.

You're welcome to include other media in your project, and I encourage you to think about creative ways of combining processes! For example, you might use the laser cutter to create an object, then the vinyl cutter to apply decoration.

You can also use any software you'd like for this project! (Though I don't suggest learning anything new at this point.)

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 17  
As you wrap up your resin printer project, you should also write up a short proposal for your final project. The goal here is to articulate what you want to do and to think about the resources needed and steps you'll take to complete it.

Your proposal should include:  
* 1–2 paragraphs explaining what you'll make: paint a word-picture for us and be as detailed as possible!  
* List of tools and supplies you'll need, including tools for assembly/finishing  
* Timeline for the project, with weekly deliverables up to the critique  
  * What will you have done each week?  
* 2 (or more) challenges you anticipate with this project – can be technical, creative, etc  
* 1 (or more) things we haven't learned yet but you'd be excited to hear more about  

When done, please submit your proposal on Canvas, either as a PDF or in the text entry box.
