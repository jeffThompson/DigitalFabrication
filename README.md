Making physical objects with computers has a long, interesting history. Numerically-controlled milling machines automated tedius manufcaturing tasks (at the expense of worker expertise) using punched tape to store programs starting the in the 1940s and 50s, followed by fully computer-controlled CNC equipment in the 1960s. Like CNC tools, 3D printers were being prototyped as early as the 1980s but it wasn't until the early 2000s that efforts like RepRap made 3D printing inexpensive and accessible. Today, we have a huge range of machines that can ooze plastic, use lasers to cut materials like wood and steel, solidify liquid resin with LCD screens, not to mention the many exciting experimental machines and projects that push what's possible with these technologies. Emerging tools are exciting for artists and designers (and many other fields!) because they offer new materials and ways of making (and limitations which can also be inspiring). And in many fields, 3D modeling and digital fabrication are now the norm, augmenting or replacing more traditional methods.

During this course, you will make art- and design-focused projects that explore a range of digital fabrication tools. The goal of these projects is for you to...  

+ Learn to design objects for digital fabrication using 2D and 3D software
+ Learn to prepare files for various tools and the ways this preparation can effect quality of the output
+ Learn to use the vinyl cutter, laser cutter, and FDM and SLA 3D printers as well as the software needed to run those machines
+ Use iterative design and prototyping to make refined projects, embracing technical challenges and things going wrong
+ Experiment with the affordances of various digital fabrication methods (and push those tools to do new things)
+ Research materials, tools, and processes; share knowledge; and critique what everyone has made
+ Make projects that you're proud of and push your skills

More specifically, our semester will be divided into five parts...

1. Vinyl cutter and Adobe Illustrator
2. Laser cutter (and more Illustrator)
3. FDM 3D printer and Autodesk Fusion 360
4. SLA 3D printer (and more Fusion 360)
5. An open-ended final project

We'll also take a field trip to [Leerform](https://www.leerform.com/) in Brooklyn to see how they use 3D scanning and various CNC machines in their work, and of course look at lots of examples of the ways creative makers are using digital fabrication tools.

Other class materials can be [found in the syllabus](Syllabus.md).

## REQUIRED TOOLS AND MATERIALS
Every effort has been made to keep this class as affordable as possible, but when making physical stuff we need... physical stuff! Please see this short list for the supplies you'll need for this class. **You'll need this starting the second week, so please order right away!**

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16T6cnRTnbwq0T4E4lAPJm2qeyNSY0rwVBPpoPIhX0ZA/edit?usp=sharing

In addition to the list above, you'll also need to budget for materials (plastic, wood), supplies for each project (glue, paint), and consumables (sandpaper, etc). This will vary depending on what you make and if (when) you mess up and need to remake something. Some materials are available for sale at the Fab Lab (offered at cost or subsidized) but we can only stock so much. For each assignment, you might want to try other materials â€“ I'll give you lots of warning so you can order stuff!

The software we'll be using is all free or provided by the VA&T program, but you will need your laptop and charger every week.

## COURSE CALENDAR  
*Since this is the first time we're running this class, we may move things around a bit to give you enough time for your projects and/or cover additional material. I'll give you a heads up about any changes but be sure to read the assignments carefully.*
